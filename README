recnn_static_graph_jet.py: Working RecNN for training in sequence jet by jet (NO batch training)

recnn_static_graph_tb_where_batch.py: Batch implementation of the RecNN using tf.where. Currently not fully working. TensorBoard was implemented, to access the computational graph and make debugging easier.
———————————————————————————————————————
Tensorboard:

First run the code where summaries are saved for Tensorboard visualization (recnn_static_graph_tb_where_batch.py has these summaries implemented)

Open Tensorboard using local web browser and see the computational graph.
